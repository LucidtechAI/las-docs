## Tutorials

Welcome to Lucidtech's API tutorials. 

If you are looking for a simple plug and play tutorial, the best place to start is this
[simple demo](https://github.com/LucidtechAI/las-docs/tree/master/tutorials/simple-demo/README.md).

(TTNote: The link above references a github page, should it instead reference the gitbook version? Also the contents of this README are just header info, perhaps you mean to link to the folder instead?)


If you need to make something a bit more customizable, check out this
[tutorial](https://github.com/LucidtechAI/las-docs/tree/master/tutorials/setup_predict_and_approve.md).

(TTNote: Again, the above link references a github page, should it instead reference the gitbook version?)

(TTNote: Consider adding a 3rd bullet here to explain when one would follow the below tutorals instead of using the 2 links above.)
