# Python SDK

## Installation
The python SDK for Lucidtech AI Services (LAS) can be downloaded from `pip`:
```commandline
$ pip install lucidtech-las
```

Don't have pip? [Here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/) are instructions for installing pip.

## Getting started 
After lucidtech-las is installed and you have received credentials, 
you are ready to enhance your document-flow with the las client:
```python
>> from las import Client
>> client = Client() 
```
If you are new to LAS we recommend you to check out the [key concepts](../../introduction) 
for a better understanding of what is possible with LAS.

If you are in the need of explicit examples on how to create complex workflows, 
check out the [tutorials](../../tutorials) 

The Python SDK is open-source, and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/LucidtechAI/las-sdk-python).
Contributions are more than welcome.
