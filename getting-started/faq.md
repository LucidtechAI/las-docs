# FAQ

## Do you have plans to support SDKs in other languages?

We provide SDKs upon request for commonly used programming languages. If you use a language that you would like
us to support, please send us a request at hello@lucidtech.ai. (TTNote: The email address appears as a mailto link in github, but does not appear as
such in another browser like Safari, consider whether this needs updating.)

## What documents do Lucidtech's APIs understand?

We currently have an invoice API for Norwegian invoices available for testing, but we can provide customized APIs matching the customer's need.

See [link](../data-training/data-training.md) for more information.
(TTNote: Consider if link should go to gitbook instead of github)

## What file formats do Lucidtech's APIs understand?

We have restricted the support to the following file formats:

* image/jpeg
* application/pdf

The restriction is for security reasons to limit the attack exposure from commonly used image decoders.
