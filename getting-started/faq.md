# FAQ

## Do you have plans to support SDKs for language X?

We provide SDKs on request for commonly used programming languages. Please send us a request to hello@lucidtech.ai.

## What documents do Lucidtech's APIs understand?

We currently have an invoice API for norwegian invoices available for testing, but customized APIs matching the customer's need.

See [link](https://github.com/LucidtechAI/las-docs/tree/d80c6eb0b57b989919d570bc1e0a6f80afec78eb/data-training/data-training/README.md) for more information.

## What file formats do Lucidtech's APIs understand?

We have restricted the support to the following file formats:

* image/jpeg
* application/pdf

The restriction is for security reasons to limit the attack surface on commonly used image decoders.
